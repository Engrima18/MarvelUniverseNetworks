# Homework 5 - Networks
### 3-rd Homework for the course in Algorithmic Methods for Data Mining (ADM) at La Sapienza university of Rome.

## Short description
In the marvel universe we manage the relationships between the various superheroes based on their "collaborations" and encounters in terms of appearances in shared comic books. We then proceed with the construction of a real social network and use our knowledge of graph theory to analyze the network (contrariety, connectivity, etc...).
The data analysis is performed on data from [The Marvel Universe Social Network](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/csanhueza/the-marvel-universe-social-network?select=hero-network.csv).

## Content
1. `main.ipynb`: a Jupyter Notebook that answers all the aforementioned questions, Functionalities, Visualizations, Algorithmic, Command Line, Bonus, and can be viewed [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/Mamiglia/ADM_HW_5/blob/main/main.ipynb).
2. `functions` folder: a folder containing all custom functions used in the notebook, divided in:
  >- `loader.py`: functions for loading the polished data.
  >- `input.py`: fuctions for handling user input.
3. `visualizations` folder: a folder containing all the custom functions for the visualization part of the HW.
4. `CommandLine.sh`: a file that provides the answer to the Commmand Line question.
5. `dataset` folder: contains the original dataset files
